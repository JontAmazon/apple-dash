# TODO
- add a description: super simple game, purpose: learn about backend, bla bla
- when the "Restart" button appears, the highscore list should not move downwards.

- monster movement.
- images for apples, myself, and the monster.



# Prio 2:



# Later consider:
- bouncy monster:
  - the bouncy ball should have a constant acceleration towards the player
  - the bouncy ball should bounce in the walls
  - the bouncy ball should have a bounce constant greater than 1.
